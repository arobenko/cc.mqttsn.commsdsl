# Overview
The [MQTT-SN](http://mqtt.org/2013/12/mqtt-for-sensor-networks-mqtt-sn) 
protocol is a sibling of [MQTT](http://mqtt.org). While **MQTT** is designed to be 
used over a **reliable stream** transport protocol (such as TCP/IP), the **MQTT-SN**
was designed to be used over a **datagram** transport protocol.

The protocol is defined in the [schema](dsl/schema.xml)
file using [CommsDSL](https://github.com/arobenko/CommsDSL-Specification).
The **commsds2comms** code generator from [commsdsl](https://github.com/arobenko/commsdsl)
project is used to generate CMake project with proper C++ classes that
implement protocol itself as well as protocol plugin for the
[CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion#commschampion-tools).

The [src](src) folder contains additional and/or overriding default functionality 
code snippets, that get injected into the generated code.

The generated CMake project of this protocol definition is hosted and can be
viewed at [cc.mqttsn.generated](https://github.com/arobenko/cc.mqttsn.generated)

# How to Build
This project uses CMake as its build system. Please open main
[CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) file and review available options as well as
mentioned available parameters, which can be used in addition to standard 
ones provided by CMake itself, to modify the default build. 

The **commsdsl2comms** application from [commsdsl](https://github.com/arobenko/commsdsl)
project is used to generate appropriate C++ code. If path to externally
built **commsdsl2comms** is not provided, then this project will build the
latter itself.

The **commsdsl2comms** application (if built internally) requires 
[Boost](https://www.boost.org) library.
In case Boost libraries are not installed in expected default location
(mostly happens on Windows systems), use variables described in 
[CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.8/module/FindBoost.html) 
to help CMake find required libraries and headers. 
It is recommended to use `-DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=ON` parameter to force
linkage with static Boost libraries.

If code generation output directory is not provided, it defaults to 
`output` subdirectory of the one used to build the project.

### Linux Build
```
$> cd /source/of/this/project
$> mkdir build && cd build
$> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install ..
$> make 
```
To build the generated project continue with
```
$> cd output && mkdir build && cd build
$> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install ..
$> make install
```

### Windows Build
```
$> cd C:\source\of\this\project
$> mkdir build
$> cd build
$> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \ 
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%cd%/install \
    -DBOOST_ROOT="C:\Libraries\boost_1_65_1" -DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=ON ..
$> nmake 
```
To build the generated project continue with
```
$> cd output 
$> mkdir build 
$> cd build
$> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCC_QT_DIR=C:\Qt\5.6.3\msvc2015 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%cd%/install ..
$> nmake install
```
To deploy Qt5 libraries into the installation directory continue with
```
$> nmake deploy_qt
```
